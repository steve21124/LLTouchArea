LLTouchArea is a view that saves the dev from the boring UIGestureRecognizer object creation and configuration.
By setting the bitmask supportedGestures and the blocks to be called when a gesture is recognized, the view will auto-configure and auto-assign gestures.

Example (in another view class):

LLTouchArea *touchArea = [[LLTouchArea alloc] initWithFrame:self.bounds];
[self addSubview:touchArea];

touchArea.supportedGestures = LLTouchAreaGestureTap | LLTouchAreaGesturePinch;

[touchArea setTapHandler:^(UITapGestureRecognizer *tapGesture) {
    NSLog(@"received tap gesture with number of taps: %i", tapGesture.numberOfTapsRequired);
}];

[touchArea setPinchHandler:^(UIPinchGestureRecognizer *pinchGesture) {
    NSLog(@"received pinch gesture");
}];

That's all!
