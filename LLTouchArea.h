/** LLTouchArea is a view that saves the dev from the boring UIGestureRecognizer object creation and configuration.
 By setting the bitmask supportedGestures and the blocks to be called when a gesture is recognized, the view will auto-configure and auto-assign gestures.
 
 Example (in another view class):
 
 LLTouchArea *touchArea = [[LLTouchArea alloc] initWithFrame:self.bounds];
 [self addSubview:touchArea];
 
 touchArea.supportedGestures = LLTouchAreaGestureTap | LLTouchAreaGesturePinch;
 
 [touchArea setTapHandler:^(UITapGestureRecognizer *tapGesture) {

 }];
 
 [touchArea setPinchHandler:^(UIPinchGestureRecognizer *pinchGesture) {
    NSLog(@"received pinch gesture");
 }];
 
 That's all!
